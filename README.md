Changes in filters are detected and the table will be updated accordingly. All filter parameters can also be entered simultaneously.

## Summary

- one drawback is that some filters will have no results. 
- there should be a dropdowns for each filter so the user is able to get results in their table every time.
- there should also be a button added to refresh the filters instead of having to refresh the page for a new search.
